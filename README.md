# MY_SOC_LEARNING_JOURNEY
Welcome to my personal journey in the world of cybersecurity! This repository serves as a public portfolio of my hands-on learning, practical exercises, and in-depth analyses as I train to become a proficient Security Operations Center (SOC) analyst.

Here, you'll find:

**Incident Response Simulations:** Detailed reports on simulated/AI generated security events or incidents, from initial alert triage to post-incident analysis. Each scenario walks through my thought process, investigative steps, and proposed remediation steps.

**Threat Intelligence Deep Dives:** Analyses of current sector-specific threats and comprehensive breakdowns of threat actor tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).[Coming Soon]

**Labs & Write-ups:** Documentation of practical lab exercises, CTF challenges, and technical write-ups to demonstrate hands-on application of security concepts. [Coming Soon]

My goal is to continuously expand my knowledge in threat detection, incident handling, digital forensics, and proactive security measures. Join me as I explore the complexities of the blue team domain!
